						<h5>1. General; Acceptance of Terms and Conditions; Restrictions</h5>

By accessing or using any part of the Service, you represent that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions including any future modifications. Nimble Lingo may amend, update, or change these Terms and Conditions. If we do this, we will post a notice that we have made changes to these Terms and Conditions on the Websites for at least 7 days after the changes are posted and will indicate at the bottom of the Terms and Conditions the date these terms were last revised. Any revisions to these Terms and Conditions will become effective the earlier of (i) the end of such 7-day period or (ii) the first time you access or use the Service after such changes. If you do not agree to abide by these Terms and Conditions, you are not authorized to use, access, or participate in the Service</p>

						<p>By accessing the app through any medium, you acknowledge that you have read and understand and accept and agree to be bound by all conditions imposed in these Terms and Conditions.  Nimble Lingo reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time without notice. Any change in these Terms and Conditions is effective immediately. Notice may be given through e-mail, posting on the website or app, or any other means by which you may obtain notice. You should periodically check these Terms and Conditions for changes. Any use of the app or website after changes have been made shall be deemed acceptance of those changed Terms and Conditions. Use of the app or website is voluntary.

Nimble Lingo has the exclusive right to control accessibility, hours of use, features on the app and any other information found on the app. Nimble Lingo can restrict access to any or all portions of the website or app or remove any information or content from the website or app at any time. Nimble Lingo reserves the right to monitor use of the website or app. You are solely responsible for providing the equipment related to accessing the website or app, including all computer, remote communications equipment, telephone, or other equipment.</p>

						<p>Any access to or use of the website or app by anyone under the age of majority requires consent to this Agreement by a parent or legal guardian. By accessing or using the app or related services, you represent and warrant to us that you are either a legal adult or, if under the age of majority, have obtained proper consent from a parent or legal guardian to your use of the app and this Agreement.

We make no claims that the app is appropriate outside of the United States. Those who choose to access the app from locations outside of the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable, including, without limitation, all applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding the transmission of data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.</p>
						<p><strong>
							PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES (PROVISION 19) THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS.</strong></p>

						<h5>6. Release and Indemnification of Nimble Lingo</h5>
						<p>In the event you have a dispute with one or more users of the app (including, but not limited to, any dispute regarding any transaction or Company generated content) or any third party app that may be linked to or otherwise interact with the app, including, without limitation, any social media website or app, you hereby agree to release and forever discharge Nimble Lingo and its agents, directors, shareholders, members, partners, managers, officers, employees, information providers, suppliers, distributors, vendors, contractors, licensors, attorneys, affiliates, successors and assigns (collectively, “Released Parties”) from any and all rights, claims, complaints, demands, causes of action, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, legal fees, costs and disbursements of any nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, which now or hereafter arise from, relate to, or are connected with such dispute and/or your use of the app, to the fullest extent provided by law.</p>
						<p>You further agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless, to the fullest extent provided by law, Released Parties from and against all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, expenses, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from, arising out of, or in connection with your use, unlawful use or other misuse, or inability to use the app, your breach of this Agreement, or otherwise relating to the business we conduct on the app (including, without limitation, any potential or actual communication, transaction, or dispute between you and any other third party), any action taken by Released Parties as a consequence of investigations by either Released Parties or law enforcement authorities, any content posted by you or on your behalf to the app, any use of any service provided by a third party provider, or any use of a service offered by us that interacts with a third party website or app, including any social media website or app. You shall cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and you shall not settle any matter without our written consent. This Section survives termination of this Agreement.</p>
						
						<h5>7. License to Apps</h5>
						<p>Subject to the terms of these Terms and Conditions, Nimble Lingo grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive license to download, install, and use one copy of each App in object code form only on an interactive wireless device that you own or control. You may not derive or attempt to derive the source code of all or any portion of any App, permit any third party to derive or attempt to derive such source code, or reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or translate any App or any part thereof. Nimble Lingo and its licensors own and shall retain all intellectual property rights and other rights in and to the Apps, and any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto. The following terms and conditions apply to you only if you are using the Apps from the Apple App Store. To the extent the other terms and conditions of these Terms and Conditions are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of this paragraph, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in this paragraph apply, but solely with respect to Apps from the Apple App Store. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms and Conditions are solely between you and Nimble Lingo, not Apple, and that Apple has no responsibility for the Apps or content thereof. Your use of any App must comply with the App Store Terms of Service. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Apps. In the event of any failure of any App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if any, for the App to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Apps, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by these Terms and Conditions. You and Nimble Lingo acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the Apps or your possession and/or use of any App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that an App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. You and Nimble Lingo acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that any App or your possession and use of that App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Nimble Lingo, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms and Conditions. You must comply with applicable third-party terms of agreement when using any App. You and Nimble Lingo acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of these Terms and Conditions as they relate to your license of the Apps, and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms and Conditions against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.</p>

						<h5>8. In-App Purchases</h5>
						<p>If you purchase an auto-renewing periodic subscription through the Service, your Nimble Lingo account will be billed continuously for the subscription until you terminate it as set forth below. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your Nimble Lingo account and follow instructions to terminate or change your subscription, even if you have deleted your account.</p>
						<p>In the Service, you may be able to purchase, with “real world” money, a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use (a) “virtual currency,” including but not limited to virtual gems, solely for use in the Service, and (b) “virtual in-app items” (together with “virtual currency,” “Virtual Items”). You may be allowed to purchase Virtual Items through the Service, and not in any other way.</p>
						<p>Nimble Lingo may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice. Nimble Lingo may update the pricing of Virtual Items at any time in its sole discretion and may add new Virtual Items for additional fees. Nimble Lingo shall have no liability to you or any third party if Nimble Lingo exercises any such rights.</p>
						<p>The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited except where expressly authorized in the Service. Other than as expressly authorized in the Service, you shall not sell, redeem, or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity, including but not limited to Company, another user, or any third party.</p>
						<p>You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using a Nimble Lingo account registered to you. Nimble Lingo may revise the pricing for the goods and services offered through the Service at any time. All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will pay any applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such purchases, transactions, or other monetary transaction interactions.</p>
						
						<h5>9. Payment Processors</h5>
						<p>All financial transactions made in connection with the Service will be processed by a third party in accordance with their respective terms of use, privacy policy, and/or any applicable payment terms and conditions. We encourage you to learn about the practices of such third party. In no event will Nimble Lingo be responsible for the actions or inactions of any third-party payment processor, including, but not limited to, system downtime or payment service outages.</p>
						
						<h5>10. Refund Policy</h5>
						<p>In the event that Nimble Lingo suspends or terminates your use of the Service or these Terms and Conditions or you close your account voluntarily, you understand and agree that you will receive no refund or exchange of any kind.</p>
						
						<h5>11. Third-Party Links, Sites, and Services</h5>
						<p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by Nimble Lingo. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access any third-party website, service, or content from Nimble Lingo, you understand that these Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy do not apply to your use of such sites. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Nimble Lingo shall not be responsible or liable, directly, or indirectly, for any damage or loss arising from your use of any third-party website, service, or content.</p>
						<p>The Service may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the Content or information on the Service, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by Nimble Lingo on the Service are subject to change. In consideration for Nimble Lingo granting you access to and use of the Service, you agree that Nimble Lingo and its third party providers and partners may place such advertising in connection with the display of content or information submitted by you or others.</p>
						
						<h5>12. Violation of These Terms and Conditions</h5>
						<p>Nimble Lingo may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the app, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Nimble Lingo’s rights or property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the app, including Nimble Lingo’s customers. Nimble Lingo always reserves the right to disclose any information that Nimble Lingo deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. Nimble Lingo also may disclose your information when Nimble Lingo determines that applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes. You acknowledge and agree that Nimble Lingo may preserve any transmittal or communication by you with Nimble Lingo through the app or any service offered on or through the app, and may also disclose such data if required to do so by law, or Nimble Lingo determines that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce these Terms and Conditions, (3) respond to claims that any data violates the rights of others, or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Nimble Lingo, its employees, users of or visitors to the app, and the public. You agree that Nimble Lingo may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the app and/or block your future access to the app if we determine that you have violated these Terms and Conditions or other agreements or guidelines which may be associated with your use of the app. You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms and Conditions will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Nimble Lingo, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Nimble Lingo obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that Nimble Lingo deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Nimble Lingo may have at law or in equity. You agree that Nimble Lingo may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the app, for cause, which includes (but is not limited to): (1) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions), (3) discontinuance or material modification of the app or any service offered on or through the app, (4) unexpected technical issues or problems, and  (5) failure by you to pay any amounts due to Nimble Lingo, in which case all of your data and information will be deleted from the app.  If Nimble Lingo does take any legal action against you as a result of your violation of these Terms and Conditions, Nimble Lingo will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all attorneys’ fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to Nimble Lingo. You agree that Nimble Lingo will not be liable to you or to any third party for termination of your access to the app because of any violation of these Terms and Conditions.</p>

						<h5>13. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</h5>
						<p>Although Nimble Lingo has attempted to provide accurate information on the app, it makes no guarantee or warranty, express or implied, as to the reliability, accuracy, timeliness or completeness of that information and assumes no responsibility for any errors or omissions therein. YOU ACCESS THIS APP AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS, AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AND ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED. NEITHER NIMBLE LINGO NOR ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS RESULTING FROM USE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION OR CONTENT ON THIS APP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OR DAMAGE TO DATA, OR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COMPENSATORY OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, THIS DISCLAIMER IS APPLICABLE TO ANY DAMAGE OR INJURY RESULTING FROM NEGLIGENCE OR OMISSION OF NIMBLE LINGO, COMPUTER VIRUS OR OTHER SIMILAR ITEM, TELECOMMUNICATIONS ERRORS, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF COMPANY INFORMATION THROUGH THEFT OR ANY OTHER MEANS. NIMBLE LINGO IS NOT LIABLE FOR CRIMINAL, TORTIOUS, OR NEGLIGENT ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD PARTIES THAT AFFECT THIS APP. IN NO EVENT WILL NIMBLE LINGO OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, ASSIGNS OR THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY TORTIOUS OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER COMPANIES. IN NO EVENT WILL NIMBLE LINGO OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES OR ASSIGNS BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT, HARDWARE OR OTHER PROPERTY OF COMPANY OR PERSONAL INJURY THAT ARISES IN CONNECTION WITH USE OF THE APP. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
						
						<h5>14. Termination</h5>
						<p>Nimble Lingo may terminate your access and use of the Service immediately at any time, for any reason, and at such time you will have no further right to use the Service. You may terminate your Nimble Lingo account at any time by following the instructions available through the Service. The provisions of these Terms and Conditions relating to the protection and enforcement of Nimble Lingo’s proprietary rights, your representations and warranties, disclaimer of representations and warranties, release and indemnities, limitations of liability and types of damages, ownership of data and information, governing law and venue, and miscellaneous provisions shall survive any such termination.</p>
						
						<h5>15. Proprietary Rights in Service Content and Activity Materials</h5>
						<p>All content available through the Service, including designs, text, graphics, images, information, software, audio and other files, and their selection and arrangement (the "Service Content"), are the proprietary property of Nimble Lingo or its licensors. No Service Content may be modified, copied, distributed, framed, reproduced, republished, downloaded, scraped, displayed, posted, transmitted, or sold in any form or by any means, in whole or in part, other than as expressly permitted in these Terms and Conditions. You may not use any data mining, robots, scraping, or similar data gathering or extraction methods to obtain Service Content. As between you and Nimble Lingo, all data, information and materials generated from your access and use of the educational activities made available on or through the Service, including translated content generated by you (collectively, the “Activity Materials”), shall be exclusively owned by Nimble Lingo, and you shall not have any right to use such Activity Materials except as expressly authorized by these Terms and Conditions.

						<h5>19.	Governing Law and Arbitration; No Class Action</h5>

						<p>These Terms and Conditions, its subject matter and Nimble Lingo’s and your respective rights under these Terms and Conditions, as well as and any claim, cause of action or dispute (“claim”) arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions, shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States of America, excluding the conflict of law provisions of that or any other jurisdiction, regardless of your country of origin or where you access the Service. ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR THE SERVICE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except for Nimble Lingo’s right to seek injunctive relief as set forth below. Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding.</p>
						<p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Nimble Lingo and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to <a href="mailto:terms@nimblelingo.com">terms@nimblelingo.com</a> within 30 days of the day you first access or use the Service.</p>
						<p>If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to Nimble Lingo’s Administration Office of your intent to arbitrate (“Notice”). The Notice to Nimble Lingo should be sent by any of the following means: (i) electronic mail to terms@nimblelingo.com; or (ii) sending the Notice by U.S. Postal Service certified mail to Nimble Lingo, Inc., Attention: Legal, 950 N. Washington St., Suite 316, Alexandria, VA 22314. The Notice must (x) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (y) set forth the specific relief sought; and (z) set forth your name, address and contact information. If we intend to seek arbitration against you, we will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you.</p>
						<p>The arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single arbitrator in the County of Fairfax in the Commonwealth of Virginia, whose decision will be final and binding, and the arbitral proceedings will be governed by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) as modified by these Terms and Conditions. The JAMS Rules are available at <a href="//www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a>. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms and Conditions. If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the JAMS Rules. We will reimburse all other JAMS filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you, unless the arbitrator determines that the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, in which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the JAMS Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. For any claim where the potential award is reasonably likely to be $10,000 or less, either you or Nimble Lingo may elect to have the dispute resolved through non-appearance-based arbitration.</p>
						<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, YOU AND NIMBLE LINGO EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, YOU AND NIMBLE LINGO EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you and Nimble Lingo agree that all claims arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the County of Fairfax in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and you and Nimble Lingo each agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such claims. Notwithstanding the above, you agree that Nimble Lingo shall still be allowed to apply for and obtain injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
						
						<h5>20.	Language</h5>
						<p>This agreement was originally written in English (US). To the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.</p>
						
						<h5>21.	California Resident</h5>
						<p>If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code § 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>
						
						<h5>22.	Miscellaneous</h5>
						<p>These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between Nimble Lingo and you concerning the subject matter hereof. In the event that any of the Terms and Conditions are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms and Conditions shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. A waiver by Nimble Lingo or you of any provision of these Terms and Conditions or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. Nimble Lingo may assign its rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions without condition. These Terms and Conditions will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of Nimble Lingo and you, and Nimble Lingo’s and your respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>
