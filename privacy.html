					<div class="col">
						<h5>1. General</h5>


						<p>At Nimble Lingo, we care about your personal data, so we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and share it.</p>

						<p>This Privacy Policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) details the personal data Nimble Lingo (“<strong>Nimble Lingo</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”) receives about you, how we process it and your rights and obligations in relation to your personal data. Nimble Lingo is the data controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”) and any relevant local legislation (“<strong>Data Protection Laws</strong>”).</p>

						<p>By using or accessing the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we do this and the changes are material, we will post a notice that we have made changes to this Privacy Policy on the Website for at least 7 days before the changes are made, and we will indicate the date these terms were last revised at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. Any revisions to this Privacy Policy will become effective at the end of that 7-day period.</p>

						<h5>2. U.S. Governing Law</h5>

						<p>The App is designed for and targets U.S. audiences, and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of The United States. We make no representation that the App and Services are operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations, and we do not warrant or imply that the App and Services are appropriate for use outside of the United States. By using the App or Services, you certify that you meet the age and other eligibility requirements set forth in our standard Terms and Conditions.  If you do not meet such age and other eligibility requirements, please discontinue using the App and Services immediately, as your continued use indicates that you are agreeing to the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your information as described in this Policy.</p>

						<p>If you are located outside of the United States, you use the App and Services at your own risk and initiative, and you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable local, national and international laws. By using the App, Services and/or providing us with any information, you: (a) consent to the transfer and processing of any information to and in the U.S., (b) acknowledge that U.S. law may provide a lower standard of protection for personal data than the laws of your location, and (c) understand that we will collect, transfer, store, process, manage and/or handle your information in accordance with this Policy and U.S. law. Consequently, to the fullest extent permitted by law, you hereby waive any claims relating to the processing of your information in accordance with this Policy that may arise under the laws and regulations of any other country or jurisdiction</p>


						<h5>3.	Information We Collect</h5>

						<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal data.  We may, and you authorize us to, use and disclose any information: (1) we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, governmental request or legal process served on us or our affiliates; (2) to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (3) to enforce our standard Terms and Conditions, take precautions against liability, investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, assist government enforcement agencies, or protect the security or integrity of the App and Services; (4) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Nimble Lingo, our users, or others; (5) to other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection and risk reduction; and (6) to enforce any agreement we have with you. We also use your personal information for our everyday business purposes such as security, operations, reporting, making back-ups, and legal compliance.</p>
						<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. User, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution (e.g., sales in bankruptcy or liquidation where the business is not continuing as a going concern).</p>
						<p>We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use the App or Services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful, as determined in our sole discretion. Release of your personal information for security purposes to any person or entity under any circumstances, including, without limitation, in connection with any government investigation or litigation, shall be based on a determination made solely by us, exercising our own discretion, permission for which is expressly granted by you to us in accordance with this Policy.</p>
						<p>We may also use your contact information to send you email or other communications regarding, among other things, questions related to your accounts, reminders about upcoming events, or to respond to your questions. We may also use this information to let you know about new or special product offerings, App functions, features and services or to notify you about updates to this Policy as described below. We may also share aggregated anonymous information about our users with other third parties. For example, these aggregated statistics may include the number of users we attract to the App or an analysis of the various characteristics of our users. None of this aggregated data, however, is tied to you or your organization-specific information when it is disclosed to any third party except as set forth herein. We will also disclose user information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures will help us comply with all applicable laws and other governmental regulations, for example, responding to a court order or subpoena. We will also disclose this information when we determine in good faith that the disclosure will help enforce our standard Terms and Conditions for the App, protect the safety or security of our users or their data and/or to protect the safety or security of the public, our App, business or our other property. Finally we will disclose and transfer personally identifiable, account and other information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our business in a merger, purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets or some other transaction. If we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, all of our information may also be transferred in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. You will be notified of any such transaction in an email or by a prominent notice posted on the App.</p>

						<h5>6.	Third party websites and links</h5>
						<p>Please note that you may have cookies placed on your computer by third party websites that refer you to our Service. Although we do not share your personal data with these third party websites unless it is reasonably necessary to offer the Service, they may be able to link certain non-personally identifiable information we transfer to them with personal data they previously collected from you. Please review the privacy policies of each website you visit to better understand their privacy practices. In addition, Nimble Lingo would like to inform you that anytime you click on links (including advertising banners), which take you to third party websites, you will be subject to the third parties’ privacy policies.</p>
						<p>Our Services may contain links to other sites operated by third parties. Nimble Lingo does not control such other sites and is not responsible for their content, their privacy policies, or their use of personal data, including any personal or financial information collected by our third party payment processor to process payments for in-app purchases. Nimble Lingo’s inclusion of such links does not imply any endorsement of the content on such sites or of their owners or operators except as disclosed on the Services. Any information submitted by you directly to these third parties is subject to that third party’s privacy policy.</p>
